# WizFight
This is the open source release of WizFight. It is provided as-is. Anything in this repository should be considered public domain, but the assets are not.

This copy of the source code will not compile without the assets. You can get the assets to build the game by downloading the pre-compiled release of the game from the itch.io page (https://twocredits.itch.io/wizfight). You should be able to simply copy the assets into their respective folders.

You will also need Haxe (https://haxe.org) in order to compile the game. I am not sure if it will compile using its current version. Last time I updated Haxe, it threw a few errors.
