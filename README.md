# WizFight
This is the open source release of WizFight. It is provided as-is. Anything in this repository should be considered public domain, but the assets are not.

This copy of the source code will not compile without the assets. You can get the assets to build the game by downloading the pre-compiled release of the game from the itch.io page (https://twocredits.itch.io/wizfight). You should be able to simply copy the assets folder into the source code's root folder.

You will also need both Haxe and HaxePunk in order to compile the game. I am not sure if it will compile using their respective current versions. Last time I updated Haxe and HaxePunk, it threw a few errors.
